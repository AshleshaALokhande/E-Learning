However, the very first attempts at e-learning can be traced back to 1924, when Ohio State University professor Sidney Pressey created the very first electronic learning machine, the Automatic Teacher.Perhaps the most significant invention in the history of online learning technology is the PLATO. The PLATO is a computer system designed by Donald L. Bitzer in 1960, and it was groundbreaking for its time. 
        Two decades before the invention of the World Wide Web, the PLATO network could host thousands of users at its peak, and much of the greatest instructional software of the century across many educational disciplines was created on PLATO.
